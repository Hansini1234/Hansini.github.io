Drawing and sketching: it’s my favorite way to relax and express myself.
Reading up on AI and space exploration because, honestly, the future and the universe are just mind-blowing.
Playing strategy games and hunting down rare in-game items (I can’t resist a good challenge!).
I also love learning new things like coding and digital design—it’s so fun finding new ways to be creative.
